# The version of DuckDB and its Vortex extension is either implicitly set by Git tag, e.g. v1.2.2, or commit
# SHA if the current commit does not have a tag. The implicitly set version can be overridden by defining the
# `OVERRIDE_GIT_DESCRIBE` environment variable. In context of the DuckDB community extension build, we have to
# rely on the Git tag, as DuckDB's CI performs a checkout by Git tag. Therefore, the version can't be explicitly
# set via environment variable for the community extension build.
